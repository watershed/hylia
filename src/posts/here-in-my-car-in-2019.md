It’s 2019, and today I bought a new old car and it’s not electric. I made a crappy choice from a crappy set of options, and here’s my crappy justification for it.

## Taking the high road

I’ve driven for 25 years, during which time I’ve now owned 6 cars. All my cars have been petrol powered and none of them new. In large part the second hand option has been driven by financial constraint. 

Quite apart from whether one has £20k or more to spare (I don’t), or can access lines of credit to that extent (I can), who in their right mind would pay that sort of money for a new family car when they could pay less than a quarter of that for a perfectly OK used car? [Hundreds of thousands of people and businesses](https://www.smmt.co.uk/vehicle-data/car-registrations) is who.

But similar to how my decision to become vegetarian in the 80s began as a health choice and then the post-rationalisation of ethical motivations swiftly followed, for a long time I’ve felt good about driving a second hand car once I learned that:

> The embodied emissions of a car typically rival the exhaust pipe emissions over its entire lifetime.

[What’s the carbon footprint of … a new car?](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/sep/23/carbon-footprint-new-car)

I’m a better person by buying a car that’s already been made, right? Well, less bad perhaps.

## On a highway to Hell

As the article linked to above says:

> Attempts to capture all these stages [of emissions] by adding them up individually are doomed from the outset to result in an underestimate, because the task is just too big.

So all analyses are to be taken with a pinch of salt and a heavy dose of perspective. Nonetheless, those [pesky Europeans](https://greenallianceblog.org.uk/2016/01/28/seven-things-you-should-know-about-the-eu-and-the-environment/) at the European Environment Agency have a good 2017 article on some of the realities of [driving to an electric future](https://www.eea.europa.eu/signals/signals-2017/articles/driving-to-an-electric-future#tab-news-and-articles), in which one can find the following telling chart.

If vehicle manufacture and disposal is really only a fifth of the lifetime emissions for a petrol car, my second hand purchases don’t look quite so virtuous do they.

But then neither does the purchase of an electric vehicle powered by an EU average mix of electricity generation which results in: 

* ~30% _more_ emissions in manufacture
* ~40% fewer emissions thereafter

The 25% net reduction in emissions overall is to be welcomed, and the prospect of 70% smaller emissions for a car powered solely by renewable sources is a massive improvement on that. But even then, using the above data, the lifetime emissions of a battery powered car driven 220,000 km (137,000 miles) is about **17 metric tonnes of CO<sup>2</sup>** (as opposed to the 54 tonnes of my second hand jalopies).

There are an estimated [1.3 billion](https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-advice/how-many-cars-are-there-in-the-world-70629) cars in the world today. And from here, economists, wonks and [techno-optimists](https://nextbillionseconds.com/2019/02/13/the-next-billion-cars-episode-1-the-next-billion-problems), who like to project from the recent past into an ever-growing, prosperous future, tell us there will be [2 billion cars by 2040](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/04/the-number-of-cars-worldwide-is-set-to-double-by-2040) – blithely ignoring environmental constraints as they do so.

Let's say that all cars by then will be 100% electric and that all electricity that powers them will be from renewable sources (good luck with that). That's an installed base of cars that over its lifetime of currently expected use will generate 34 gigatons of CO<sup>2</sup>, or just over 9 gigatons of carbon ([34/3.67](https://thinkprogress.org/the-biggest-source-of-mistakes-c-vs-co2-c0b077313b/)).

The reality of course won't pan out like that.

For one thing, the installed base of 1.3 billion fossil fuelled cars will presumably have emitted about 19 gigatons of carbon before it’s consigned to the scrapheap of steel and non-recyclable plastic and [tyres](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00035qh).

## Putting this in perspective

There remain huge uncertainties about [how much more carbon we can ‘safely’ burn this century](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-much-carbon-budget-is-left-to-limit-global-warming-to-1-5c), but the _really_ inconvenient truth is that those of us privileged enough to have been able to drive where we like, when we like, are going to have to get used to driving being a luxury again. And those who have never  driven will have wholly different circles to square and judgments to make.

Collectively, we are going to have to drive less because the physics of climate don't care whether we burn carbon behind a wheel or in our [leaky Victorian houses](https://www.theccc.org.uk/2019/02/21/uk-homes-unfit-for-the-challenges-of-climate-change-ccc-says/), [shipped](https://inews.co.uk/news/long-reads/cargo-container-shipping-carbon-pollution/) in our Amazon delivery, or [cemented](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/28062018/global-warming-pollution-industrial-sources-cement-steel-trade-solutions-technology-shipping) into our built environment.

We can attempt to hang on to jobs in industries of the past by rearranging the [Honda](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/21/honda-european-chief-outlined-no-deal-brexit-concerns-in-2018) deckchairs on the Brexit Titanic. The climate **does not care**.

All this was in my head today as I signed on to buying another car, to replace the one that had reached the end of its road.

I did consider another option.

## Car sharing: baby you can drive my car 

And I can drive yours. That’s the vision of the car sharing future. It’s a better one than the mess we are in now. And it’s kind of, sort of arrived in Portsmouth where I live.

I didn’t want to buy a new car, so I joined the Enterprise Car Club that opened in Portsmouth in September 2018. But there’s not a lot of vehicle choice, it’s not clear to me how many vehicles they have to match demand, and cars are only available from their depot 2 miles from where I live.

Other, larger cities have other options, like Zipcar in Bristol, Cambridge, London or Oxford. No use to me.



 Fahren, fahren, fahren auf der Autobahn
