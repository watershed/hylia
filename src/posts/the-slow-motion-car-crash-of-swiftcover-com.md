Back in 2009, Gerry McGovern wrote an article that has stayed with me, in which he asked a question:

> If your customers fall in the forest of your website and you don’t hear them scream, did they really make a sound?

And then [answered](http://gerrymcgovern.com/if-your-customer-falls-in-the-forest-of-your-website): 

> Yes they did. It was the sound of them clicking on the Back (I’m outta here and I won’t be back) button.

Today, that person was me on [swiftcover.com](http://www.swiftcover.com), trying to find the cost of changing the insured car on my existing insurance policy.

Bear in mind that I interact with car purchase and car insurance as infrequently as possible because they are a dead-end technology that is still a necessary evil (sadly), and anything to do with them is so often a miserable experience. So my understanding of what I’m doing, or what my options are, or the processes that must follow is minimal. There must be many, many more like me. Not everyone is a petrolhead.

## Tell your customers what is _going_ to happen

If your process is a one-page form, and its expected inputs are clearly defined, your customer can scan the form and get a sense of what is expected of them _before_ they hit submit.

But that’s not the world of car insurance. There is a litany of steps, each of which might affect the next, so it has to be a lengthy multi-part sequential process. Anytime it's your web interface's job to walk your customers through that, you have _got_ to present those steps to them up front and at each step tell them where they are in the process.

This is not new knowledge. Any half decent e-commerce checkout process has known this for at least a decade.

But SwiftCover don't do this. With them, it’s straight into the first question, with no indication of what is to follow.There is no context providedSo when the first 

It began with me logging in to my policy details and choosing the option to ‘Change car details’ and went downhill from there.
