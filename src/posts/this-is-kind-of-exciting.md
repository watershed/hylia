This thing has been created with [Hylia](https://github.com/andybelldesign/hylia#readme), a blog  starter kit made by a clever chap and all-round good egg, [Andy Bell](https://andy-bell.design), leveraging the combined power of [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) as host, and [Eleventy](https://11ty.io) as publishing system.

Eleventy is an Open Source [static site generator](/posts/static-site-generators-wtf) (SSG) made by [Zach Leatherman](https://www.zachleat.com/).

I’d been tinkering with Eleventy and Netlify on and off this spring, and not quite joining all the dots, and now Andy has made it all so easy: all you need is a Github account to [get started](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/andybelldesign/hylia).

Now I’ve finally got a place to put my thoughts that is mine to make my own (or screw up). No more lazy posting to Medium, or threading tweets in lieu of a blog post. Sure, I can still do those things _as well_, but at least my meanderings can have a home I control.
